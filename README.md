    Systems & Computer Engineering Student | Backend & Machine Learning Enthusiast

I am a proactive and curious Systems and Computer Engineering student, passionate about backend development, literature, and continuous learning.  
Currently, I am focused on becoming a Machine Learning Engineer, while exploring applications in the **energy sector and agriculture sectors**.  
I enjoy combining logic and creativity—whether through building backend solutions, training ML models, or immersing myself in books.
